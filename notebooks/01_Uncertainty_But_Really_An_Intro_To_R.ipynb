    "Introduction to R in the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://kevinjamesmccauley.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/r-programming-language-logo-785x595.png?w=785\" width=75 style=\"float:left;margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;\"> For the next five sessions, we will be using the R language for statistical computing. It has a long history, at least in conception, dating back to the early 1970s. It was developed by statisticians to support \"exploratory data analysis,\" a process we will adapt to help us find stories in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The practice involves repeated \"looks\" at a data set -- a \"look\" might be some graphical representation of the data like a plot, or the output of some form of computation like a numerical summary, a table, or a \"model\" fit. Statistians are exceptionally visual people, obsessed with \"seeing\" what the data have to offer, and \"views\" maybe provided through a variety of computational means. As a journalist, you might think of this attempt to \"see\" as a kind of interview process, with each subsequent look, a follow-up question. R is, by design, expressive in statistical computations and graphics, meaning it allows us to formulate and act on statistical ideas in an easy way. **We are breaking from Python for a few sessions because R is so well adapted to statistical work.** Most of everyting you need to know about the language, it's uses and extensions, is available on the [R project website](http://r-project.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably worth spending a moment to review the techno-social history of R -- Where did it come from? Why was it invented? Who was behind it and what problems were they struggling with. We care about the origin story of our tools because it helps us be on guard for how our analyses are being shaped by the tool makers. Every tool or platform designer has a set of use cases in mind, and you are rewarded for behaving in ways that the designers anticipated. But this can have an affect on the stories that you are capable of finding or telling with data. (Don't get me started on spreadsheets!) Here are a few good resources reviewing where R came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nick Thieme has a recent article, [R Generation](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01169.x), on the history of R that shows its age.\n",
    ">August 2018 is the 25th anniversary of the creation of R, this lingua franca of the statistics and data science communities, and here we tell the story of its birth, growth and development. The story begins quite unexpectedly, with a chance meeting between two statistics professors ‐ Ross Ihaka, now retired from the University of Auckland, and Robert Gentleman, vice president of computational biology at 23andMe. As Gentleman explains: “There was no real intention to build anything other than a toy to play around with ideas.”\n",
    "<br><br> It did not stay that way for long. R would bring the philosophy of collaboration in science to the distribution of code, democratising statistical computing. From an office in New Zealand, it scattered across the world into the hard drives of students and professors, Google data scientists, biologists, and more. It helped diversify data science intellectually ‐ and it did all this without charging its congregation a dime.\n",
    "2. [Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins has a Coursera course that starts with an R overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/pAbaE/overview-and-history-of-r)<br><br>\n",
    "3. [John Chambers, the designer of the precurser to R called S talks about his motivations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150305201743/http://www.stat.bell-labs.com/S/history.html)<br><br>\n",
    "4. [The R project website itself has a recounting of its history](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)<br><br>\n",
    "5. And it's worth seeing who is at the helm of R development these days. [Here's the R-core team from March of 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150305213410/https://www.r-project.org/foundation/members.html) and [here is the team today](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/members.html). Notice anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook you have become familiar with is a general interface to more than just Python -- you actually get  access to Julia, Python and R (which explain the name Ju-pyt-er). As with their Python siblings, you will type commands from the R language into the notebook's \"cells\" and execute them by typing \"shift-enter.\" These code cells are your place to author R, specifying manipulations of and orchestrating looks at your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells, as you know, are only half of the story. The notebook also has text cells that allow you to write comments about what you've seen in your data or to even author a final story. The text you enter in these cells will be in  [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a language that offers a simple way to create HTML pages without writing HTML. It is a \"visual\" language, meaning that you enhance your writing with simple notational conventions that let you read even the unprocessed text easily.  To see Markdown in action, double click on this cell and you'll see the underlying text. Notice that you can make italics by *surrounding text with a pair of asterisks* or boldface by using **pairs of asterisks.** (To return to the HTML view of the Markdown, hold down the shift key and hit \"enter\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start looking at R. First, you can think of R as a big calculator (a famous statistician R.A. Fisher once said that he learned all he knew over his calculator) and its simplest commands are just arithmetic expressions. Add 2 and 3 below by clicking on the cell and then hit \"enter\" while holding down the shift key -- this sends the R expression \"2+3\" to be evaluated and the answer should be returned."

    "The data we need is in a PDF table, or a series of tables. PDF (the Portable Document Format) is really good for representing data to a printer -- creating a standard like this was a huge deal when PDF was introduced. Often, however, it becomes a vehicle for publishing data and then you start to see its weaknesses. Extracting data from a PDF will depend, first, on the kind of PDF it is. If you can \"select\" text from the document, you're in luck. There are several tools to help you get reasonably close to the data. If, on the other hand, your pages are essentially images, well, then you have to rely on \"optical character recognition\" programs that cluster black and white pixels, say, into letters and words and sentences. \n",

You can read more about the format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

    "\n",
    "> **BACKGROUND.** Quantifying the effect of natural disasters on society is critical for recovery of public health services and infrastructure. The death toll can be difficult to assess in the aftermath of a major disaster. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria caused massive infrastructural damage to Puerto Rico, but its effect on mortality remains contentious. The official death count is 64.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**METHODS.** Using a representative, stratified sample, we surveyed 3299 randomly chosen households across Puerto Rico to produce an independent estimate of all-cause mortality after the hurricane. Respondents were asked about displacement, infrastructure loss, and causes of death. We calculated excess deaths by comparing our estimated post-hurricane mortality rate with official rates for the same period in 2016.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**RESULTS.** From the survey data, we estimated a mortality rate of 14.3 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8 to 18.9) per 1000 persons from September 20 through December 31, 2017. This rate yielded a total of 4645 excess deaths during this period (95% CI, 793 to 8498), equivalent to a 62% increase in the mortality rate as compared with the same period in 2016. However, this number is likely to be an underestimate because of survivor bias. The mortality rate remained high through the end of December 2017, and one third of the deaths were attributed to delayed or interrupted health care. Hurricane-related migration was substantial.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**CONCLUSIONS.** This household-based survey suggests that the number of excess deaths related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is more than 70 times the official estimate. (Funded by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and others.)"
